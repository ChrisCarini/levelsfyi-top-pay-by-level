# levelsfyi-top-pay-by-level

This repository contains information about the "Top Pay by Level" based data from [Levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi)'s "End of Year Pay Reports".

## üì£ Background

The data from Levels.fyi is a great resource for understanding the compensation landscape in the tech industry. The data is crowdsourced, and is a great way to understand what the 'market rate' is for a given role.

This repository simply takes public data from Levels.fyi's "End of Year Pay Reports" and visualizes the data in a different way for easy comparison.

## ü§ù Contributing

This repository welcomes contributions. If you have an idea for a visualization, or a different way to present the data, feel free to open an issue to start the conversation, and if you wish, a PR with the respective code change.

## üîÑ Data

The data used in this repository is sourced from Levels.fyi's "End of Year Pay Reports". The data is publicly available, and can be found at the following links:
- [2024](https://www.levels.fyi/2024/)
- [2023](https://www.levels.fyi/2023/)
- [2022](https://www.levels.fyi/2022/)
- [2021](https://www.levels.fyi/2021/)
- [2020](https://www.levels.fyi/2020/)
- [2019](https://www.levels.fyi/2019/)
- [2018](https://www.levels.fyi/2018/)

Each year a `Top Pay by Software Engineering Level` section exists, and is broken down by level of engineer - starting in 2022, additional roles in 'tech' have started to be included as well.

To generate the graphs in this repository, @ChrisCarini has gone through and collected the data from each year into `data.csv` in this repository.

## üìã TODO

- [ ] Create a script that scrapes the data from Levels.fyi

## üìö Notes

Below are notes for my own consumption.

1. It was a pain to figure out the name of the chart I was looking for; below are some names I came across, but none seem to be the definitive name
   1. Bump Chart
   2. Rank Chart
   3. Ranking Plot
   4. Pareto chart
   5. Slopegraph
   6. Parallel coordinate plot
